# CommitRevealAuction Contract

The CommitRevealAuction contract implements a commit-reveal auction mechanism on the Ethereum blockchain. This type of auction helps prevent front-running and ensures fairness in the bidding process.

## Overview

In a commit-reveal auction, the bidding process is divided into two phases:

1. **Commit Phase**: Bidders submit a hash of their bid amount and a secret value.
2. **Reveal Phase**: Bidders reveal their actual bids and secret values.

## Key Features

- Configurable auction duration
- Two-phase bidding process (commit and reveal)
- Automatic winner determination
- Secure and transparent auction mechanism
